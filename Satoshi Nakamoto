I ask everyone in the BTC universe to spread the word that I will pay Satoshi Nakamoto 18.53 btc from 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa in 2022. and make my identity public.
It is true that at the beginning 970000 btc are dug out of these 970000 btc there is no key for 960000 btc it was never written down.
I own the btc on the first btc address 18.53 btc plus forks and another 10000 btc on different addresses more that is not my entire fortune
I Satoshi Nakamoto didn't want anyone to be able to control btc and that's why the 960000 btc were dug to different addresses so that in the future no one can control it by accident either
